Description:	read/write
                Set pattern time dimension. There are five arguments.
                  (1) startup delay
                  (2) rising dimming time
                  (3) how much time stays at high level
                  (4) falling dimming time
                  (5) how much time stays at low level
                Ranges are
                  (1), (3), (5): 0 ~ 10000. Unit is millisecond.
                  (2), (4): 0 ~ 16000. Unit is millisecond.

                Example:
                No delay, rising 200ms, high 300ms, falling 100ms, low 400ms.
                echo "0 200 300 100 400" > /sys/class/leds/<led>/pattern_times

                cat /sys/class/leds/<led>/pattern_times
                delay: 0, rise: 200, high: 300, fall: 100, low: 400

Description:	read/write
                Set pattern level(brightness). There are two arguments.
                  (a) Low brightness level
                  (b) High brightness level
                Ranges are from 0 to 255.

                Example:
                Low level is 0, high level is 255.
                echo "0 255" > /sys/class/leds/<led>/pattern_levels

                cat /sys/class/leds/<led>/pattern_levels
                low brightness: 0, high brightness: 255

Description:	write only
                After 'pattern_times' and 'pattern_levels' are updated,
                run the pattern by writing 1 to 'run_pattern'.
                To stop running pattern, writes 0 to 'run_pattern'.
